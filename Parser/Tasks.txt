    Change NOT token to be a keyword.

            This might be something we need to solve on the parser. Not sure.
    Implement inverse interval token.

Parser
    IMPROVE FORALL;
    define diamond;
    define subtraction/inverse interval;
    define inverse interval;
    program assignment only needs : and not :=
        right box only needs } and not }];
            Must find a better way to deal with curly brackets. This also applies to diamond.
    Better way of representing powers.
    Division.
