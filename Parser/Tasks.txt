    Had to switch the priority of  AND and IMPLIES because we couldnt do an assignment (program) AND another
        assignment nor could we say that (this program) AND (that program) IMPLIES (something) because AND and
        IMPLIES were exclusive for propositions. Must find out if these operations are in the correct priority
        or if we need to create a separate assignment that is not a program.
    implement way of adding "," and having multiple differential assignments.
