    Change NOT token to be a keyword;

Parser
    !IMPROVE FORALL;!
    !improve restrictions!
    inverse interval;
            Might not be the most correct implementation in the parser level.
    Better way of representing powers;
    Had to switch the priority of  AND and IMPLIES because we couldnt do an assignment (program) AND another
        assignment nor could we say that (this program) AND (that program) IMPLIES (something) because AND and
        IMPLIES were exclusive for propositions. Must find out if these operations are in the correct priority
        or if we need to create a separate assignment that is not a program.
    implement *
    Parenthesis nodes might cause problems with restrictions in nodes.
    Diamond and Box need a comma or something in order to work. Must change this but not sure how.
    Make a single function for progtest, diamond, box and parenthesis.

Translator
    Figure out how to detect and translate parenthesis;
    Fix possible bugs;
    Forall node is not translated yet;
    inverse interval;
            The translation is not the best. Improve.

Features
    Translate to file
        Produce a valid .kyx file;


Code
    Refactor propBox, propDiamond, progTest since they are very similar.
